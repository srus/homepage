        <p>Thank you for visiting my website! This is the page where is suppossed that I have to tell you a few things about me, so let's dive in.</p>

        <h2>My career</h2>

        <p>Well, as you already know, I'm a software engineer working as web developer. I have some experience making cool websites and web apps. I have been working as full-stack developer mainly, programming in Python in the back-end almost all the time. Some PHP programming in the early days, but definitely not any more! I also have a Java background since the days at university, but I'm not very interested in programming in such a <em>VerboseMessyAndUgly</em> programming language. But certainly I have some interest in those functional languages around the JVM. I love the paradigm of functional programming and I have been learning some Haskell lately, since I didn't learn that language at the university (I used to program in Lisp, Prolog and CLIPS for the subjects related to <abbr title="Artificial Inteligence">AI</abbr>). But as I said, Python is my language of choice for the back-end and I'm very proud to be a Pythonist! (and a Djangonaut!)</p>

        <p>Along the time I have been improving my front-end skills, and now I consider myself as 60% front-end and 40% backend developer, maybe. I have been even teaching front-end programming in a course lately. But I'm definitely not a JavaScript lover, since its poor design (it is a terrible language, you know), but if you stick to The Good Partsâ„¢, it can be really powerful and useful. Luckily ES6 is almost here and lots of those tricks and stupid patterns will be just a bad nightmare soon. I love CoffeeScript, btw. But I think it's time to move to ES6. <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Now</a>.</p>

        <p>And now "my obsession" is web performance (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%23perfmatters">#perfmatters</a>). I have been learning all about HTTP, HTTP/2, SPDY, TLS, QUIC, to get all the best from servers and clients. And I know what is REST, really. I think Mr Fielding would be proud of me if I tell you that almost all those REST(ful) APIs out there are using the word "REST" just for marketing, mainly because they are not using <abbr title="Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State">HATEOAS</abbr>. So please, let's call them just HTTP APIs. Please.</p>
